In case of any other need, please let me know.

Please make sure your code is compliant with [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), with some tweaks allowed:

* E402 - in tests, module-level imports not being placed at the top of the source file are fine.
* E501 - maximum line length is set to 92 characters (more practical and still tidy / readable)
* E265 - it is OK to comment code without adding space after `#`
